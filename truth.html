            Yeah, am trying to be 🥸
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            I thought as much cos ur mood has been swinging a lot lately.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">Affirmative</p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            I’ve been at my worst lately when I should be at my best.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            You know that drunk feelings you get even when you’re sober
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            That sh*t is crazy bro
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">You already know.</p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            How's ur valentine going?
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            Oh, before that, how’s ya lady? Mathel.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            TBH, I don’t even know, I hope she’s doing better than ever.
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            You kidding me right? Man that lady has been in your heart for as
            long as I can’t remember.
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            How will you stay without reaching out to her?
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            Well, it’s never my intention, I tried my best you know
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            We use to chat and I’ll call once in a while to hear from her and
            feel her mood through her voice and all.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            But I guess I was rather disturbing her you know.
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">Hmm!</p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            You think she don’t feel you anymore?
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            Well, not all thoughts are true, but TBVH, I think the feelings she
            reciprocated lately was bcos it’s been long we met or talked to each
            other. Or maybe she was bored and needed some company, I really
            can’t tell. It’s just a thought.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            I may be wrong or right even though the moments we shared seemed
            genuine, but I can’t stop myself thinking that way cos there are
            many reasons to, U know.
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            Mehn, that’s deep
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            I understand how you feel
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            I hope you really do.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            I love Mathel, I really do…
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            She’s my happiness, she’s my Muse.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            I once asked her what her fav fruit was & she said “Apple” then I
            saved her number as "Apple 🍎"
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            😄😄😄… you crazy bro
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            I noticed how happy you were when you two were home ☺️
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            All I can say is, Mathel has always been my happiness
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            The feelings I have for Mathel is deep, but it’s possible that
            someone feels more for her, or she feels more for someone than she
            feels or felt for me
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            Either way, I can’t alter her decisions, I JUST CAN’T!!!

            Things we do for people we love

            You know, doing things that really hurts me just to make her happy
            is what I’m doing now. (I’ll explain this later)

          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            You know this year I left home early
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            Yeah, you were not happy you left her behind but you just had to.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            You’re a good friend, you understand me so well, I appreciate
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            Oh! A compliment from you? Man, that’s huge, I so appreciate it.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">Anytime!</p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            So, my thoughts were how often Mathel & I will be meeting because I
            felt back home we were not meeting that more often. Tho I
            underestimated our personal schedules.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            I missed her a lot when I was here alone, kept praying and hoping to
            just hug her someday again.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            Oh, my poor thoughts😒
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            Then, she finally came and that night we met after back and forth
            calls to locate her.
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">What a day 😄</p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            Yeah, it was really a day bro, I went to her house and we talked, I
            watched her arrange her stuffs, stealing glances at me once a while
            and smiling beautifully like she always does.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            God, that lady is so damn beautiful, her eyes, lips, her smiles,
            just everything about her is the best you could ask for in a lady.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            She has a kind heart, she’s lovely.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            I don’t know much about her but I can definitely write a book about
            this...
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            Chai stop e don do, you got me tripping… love Nwantiti 💚🥰
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            Hahaha… dude, you’re nuts😅
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            Listen, Nate, she’s a good lady, agreed
          </p>

          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            But you’ve to understand that just like choices, feelings change
            too.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            You’re so right, bro
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            I understand that perfectly
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            If you can remember, I said I don’t really know much about her
            right?
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            So it’s hard to figure out whether she has changed or I’m just
            discovering the real her.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            On a norm, I do meet with her whenever we decide and if it’s not
            possible do to genuine reason(s), we’ll re-schedule our rendezvous.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            But since I & her met the night she arrived in Jalingo, it has been
            one excuse to another, the more I try to understand, the more
            reasons keep poking at me with a straight gaze as to why I feel
            she’s avoiding me.
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            Yes, Nate, constant excuses are proves that someone doesn’t want to
            see you or has lost interest in whatever you two had going on.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            Mathel & I are both young adults, if she doesn’t feel anything for
            me again or she can’t keep up with my attitude or status or whatever
            it is, we can discuss this out rather than avoiding me and all.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            The Last time we spoke, she said she was on her way home, that when
            she gets there, she’ll call back.
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">Did she call?</p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            Nah, she never called, chatted nor texted back since then.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            I’ve not done so either, just because I’ve read and understood the
            writings on the wall. I can't pretend to be blind.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            So, I need nobody to read out to me.
          </p>

          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            I’m sorry you feel this way, Nate
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            This is hard to say but I think it's obvious she don't value you
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            Because no matter how busy someone is, if they hold you with some
            esteem, they will always create time for you no matter how small.
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            I mean look at you, you work from 8 - 6 yet you do try your best to
            create time.
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            I guess the feelings are no longer mutual. It is no one’s fault that
            they don’t love someone again but at least just let them know so
            that they don't date themselves. (thinking they're dating you while
            you don't think same)
          </p>

            opposite.
          </p>
          <p class="voice chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-right">
            I guess she thinks meeting with you is evil
          </p>
          <p class="me chat_bubble" data-aos="fade-left">
            Funny enough that could be true, well I admit I’m not righteous cos
            every day in this world of sin, I try to seek after righteousness.
            So, Mathel, say me a prayer while I hope to make it to heaven’s
            gate.

            Dear Mathel, <br />
            I don’t know when you’re reading this but I know you’re doing so
            now.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The chat above is between me and my state of mind. Over the weeks, I
            have had several thoughts concerning your sudden change of attitude,
            my thoughts could be wrong or right, if you read through then you
            should know better.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            I never meant to victimize you or negate your feelings or make you
            feel a certain type of way, so I don’t know how you feel or felt
            reading the chat above but believe me I can’t predict it and I have
            zero control over it.

            I called this project “Moment of Truth” because being vulnerable is
            the story of my life i.e. I say things exactly how they’re
            regardless of how people’s perception of me will change. Therefore,
            if some things I said are or were hard to take or I overstepped your
            balance, then I apologize.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            You’ve given me reasons beyond reasonable doubt that on your
            priority list, I don’t matter that much, and that hurts, but I’m
            accepting that reality anyways. You once said you won’t want to hurt
            me, well, all these times you’ve been avoiding me is the worst way
            you could ever hurt me.
